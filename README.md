I have completed the task objectives, aiming to make my code simple, readable, and easy to extend.

When it comes to testing, the easiest approach is to start with unit tests for individual small components. Integration tests are also useful for verifying specific functionalities, such as deleting or collapsing cards. It's a good idea to begin with these types of tests, but in my opinion, the most valuable are the E2E tests, which validate the functionality of the entire application. These should ideally be written before or conducted after the work is completed.
